what I've been doing to weather.csv

- replaced all T values with 0.00001

- deleted depart column, 11.5k out of 20k entries were missing

- replaced all snowfall of M with 0 if tmin > 32


- AVERAGE of 20,000 rows (TAVG - AVERAGE(TMAX-TMIN) = 0.244908)

- I'm replacing all Ms in TAVG with the average of corresponding TMAX - TMIN + 0.244908

- Replaced all Ms in snowfall in stations (1,9,13,16, 8, 10, 5) with 0s, because nonzero snowfall has never been reported at that station.

- OPEN PROBLEM: Station 5

- Deleting entire sunrise, sunset column. half of the stations don't keep track of it

what I've been doing to weather.csv

replaced all T values with 0.00001

deleted depart column, 11.5k out of 20k entries were missing

replaced all snowfall of M with 0 if tmin > 32


AVERAGE of 20,000 rows (TAVG - AVERAGE(TMAX-TMIN) = 0.244908)

I'm replacing all Ms in TAVG with the average of corresponding TMAX - TMIN + 0.244908
